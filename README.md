# Brief
You are analysing the shipments processed by PostCo. Each shipment in `shipments.csv` is created by a shop.
The shop's details, including their PostCo account managers are in `shops.csv`.
The `shipping_status.csv` has descriptions on each shipment status.

Feel free to pause, Google up documentations, and ask questions. Don't forget to have fun!
